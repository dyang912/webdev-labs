1.The answer to your accessibility questions.
    (1) Were React’s compilation warning/error messages helpful?
    Yes. The messages will show the exact line numbers and the reason why there is an error. It helps me improve
    the quality of my web page.

    (2) Did React’s compilation warning/error messages prompt you to consider making your site more accessible?
    No, they did not. The compilation errors are more about the must-obey rules or basic functions. They do not give
    me suggestions about accessibility or layout.

    (3) Did you consider conducting accessibility testing on your lab assignment? Why or why not?
    Yes. I think accessibility is important for a website, especially a page used for people interacting. With high
    accessibility, more people can visit this web page and communicate with others.

    (4) If you tested your site for accessibility and found issues, were you able to solve them? What did you do to try
    to solve them? What stopped you from successfully resolving or trying to resolve the issues?
    Yes, I could solve them. With the training and hints from the previous labs and lectures, I have basic knowledge
    about implementing accessibility on a website, such as contrast and easy-to-use.
